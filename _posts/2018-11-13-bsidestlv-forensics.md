## Background

The 2018 BSidesTLV CTF competition brought together over 310 teams burning the midnight oil to crack our challenges in a bout that lasted for two weeks. You can now enjoy the same pain and suffering, using this easy-to-use, condensed VM that now hosts all our challenges in an easy to digest format. The CTF has five categories:

+ Web (10 challenges)
+ Reverse Engineering (3 challenges)
+ Misc (3 challenges)
+ Forensics (1 challenge)
  1. <a href="#{{ 'Shared Directory' | downcase | replace: ' ', '-'}}">Shared Directory</a>
+ Crypto (2 challenges)

What follows is my humble attempt of cracking the challenges in the **Forensics** category.

### Shared Directory

This is how the challenge looks like.

There's no hiccup in unzipping `win.zip`.

</a>

The hint is strong in this one. CR and Windows? Microsoft uses `\r\n` or `CRLF` to denote end-of-line.

</a>

The creator has peppered the entire file with `CRLF`s. If you look at the modified timestamp `\xDF\xE8\x0D\x0A` at file offset `0x4`, and if you remove the byte `0x0D`, the timestamp then becomes `\xDF\xE8\x0A\x5B` which is _Sun May 27 17:20:31 UTC 2018_.

</a>

The OS also becomes Unix, which makes more sense for `.tar.gz`.

Now, let's use `dos2unix` to convert `CRLF` to `LF` in the file.

We can proceed to extraction.

</a>

After extraction, a directory `out` and file `model.json` are present. The `out` directory contains 4999 binaries. The file `model.json` contains an interesting string "FemtoZip"

Pivoting on "FemtoZip" in Google led me to a GitHub [repository](https://github.com/gtoubassi/femtozip). According to the project description,

> FemtoZip is a "shared dictionary" compression library optimized for small documents that may not compress well with traditional tools such as gzip

Well-played. "Shared Directory"? Should've been "shared dictionary" :laughing:

Following the instructions to build and decompress, this is what I got.

The flag is `BSidesTLV{F3mZ1pisTh3B3st}`.
