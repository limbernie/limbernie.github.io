## Background

Irked is a retired vulnerable VM from Hack The Box.

## Information Gathering

Letâ€™s start with a `masscan` probe to establish the open ports in the host.

```
# masscan -e tun0 -p1-65535,U:1-65535 10.10.10.117 --rate=1000

Starting masscan 1.0.4 (http://bit.ly/14GZzcT) at 2019-01-23 01:43:12 GMT
 -- forced options: -sS -Pn -n --randomize-hosts -v --send-eth
Initiating SYN Stealth Scan
Scanning 1 hosts [131070 ports/host]
Discovered open port 80/tcp on 10.10.10.117                                    
Discovered open port 111/tcp on 10.10.10.117                                   
Discovered open port 65534/tcp on 10.10.10.117                                 
Discovered open port 48358/tcp on 10.10.10.117                                 
Discovered open port 22/tcp on 10.10.10.117
```

Interesting. `masscan` finds five open ports. Let's do one better with `nmap` scanning the discovered ports.

```
# nmap -n -v -Pn -p22,80,111,48358,65534 -A --reason 10.10.10.117 -oN nmap.txt
...

Hmm. IRC? Is this what it's about?

### Remote Command Execution - UnrealIRCd 3.2.8.1

So, the IRC daemon is UnrealIRCd 3.2.8.1.

This particular version is susceptible to a remote code executation vulnerability as per EDB-ID [13853](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/13853) and it's extremely easy to exploit with `nc`.


{% include image.html image_alt="79ae3f2d.png" image_src="/c8c23ee8-1d24-4d04-b558-14339c8a6570/79ae3f2d.png" %}


Meanwhile at my `nc` listener...


{% include image.html image_alt="350c9327.png" image_src="/c8c23ee8-1d24-4d04-b558-14339c8a6570/350c9327.png" %}


Let's [upgrade](https://blog.ropnop.com/upgrading-simple-shells-to-fully-interactive-ttys/) the shell to a full TTY.

## Privilege Escalation

During enumeration of `ircd`'s account, I notice a `setuid` executable. Look at the timestamp on this guy.


{% include image.html image_alt="71fe007d.png" image_src="/c8c23ee8-1d24-4d04-b558-14339c8a6570/71fe007d.png" %}


I ran the executable and spotted something very interesting. A `setuid` executable trying to run another executable that's missing? I smell privilege escalation.


{% include image.html image_alt="2a95e3aa.png" image_src="/c8c23ee8-1d24-4d04-b558-14339c8a6570/2a95e3aa.png" %}


Simply `echo` the following Python code to `/tmp/listusers` and make it executable should do the trick.


{% include image.html image_alt="4b9f47d2.png" image_src="/c8c23ee8-1d24-4d04-b558-14339c8a6570/4b9f47d2.png" %}


Getting `user.txt` and `root.txt` should be easy with a `root` shell.

:dancer:

## Afterthought

I thought it was interesting to share an additional observation during my enumeration of `ircd`'s account. I was looking for `user.txt` and found a text file `.backup` at `/home/djmardov/Documents`.


{% include image.html image_alt="ac818761.png" image_src="/c8c23ee8-1d24-4d04-b558-14339c8a6570/ac818761.png" %}


The content of the file `.backup` is as follows.


{% include image.html image_alt="baf0c966.png" image_src="/c8c23ee8-1d24-4d04-b558-14339c8a6570/baf0c966.png" %}


It appears that some kind of steganography is going on here. If I have to guess, I would say that something is hidden in this image and that the password is `UPupDOWNdownLRlrBAbaSSss`. Damn, that's the [Konami Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code)!


{% include image.html image_alt="92895787.png" image_src="/c8c23ee8-1d24-4d04-b558-14339c8a6570/92895787.png" %}


Anyways, the box doesn't have any stego tools installed, so I enlisted the help of an online [tool](https://futureboy.us/stegano/decinput.html) to do the job of ***unhiding***, if you will.


{% include image.html image_alt="20c047a7.png" image_src="/c8c23ee8-1d24-4d04-b558-14339c8a6570/20c047a7.png" %}



{% include image.html image_alt="a584a579.png" image_src="/c8c23ee8-1d24-4d04-b558-14339c8a6570/a584a579.png" %}


There you have it. That must be `djmardov`'s password.


{% include image.html image_alt="95c5c2a0.png" image_src="/c8c23ee8-1d24-4d04-b558-14339c8a6570/95c5c2a0.png" %}
