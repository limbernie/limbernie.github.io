# Introduction

Potion is a customized Jekyll theme partially derived from the work of others,
namely:

* [Leonids](https://github.com/renyuanz/leonids) by Renyuan Zou
* [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) by Mark Otto
* [So Simple](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme) by Micheal Rose

The theme represents a concoction of the parts I like about from the other
themes, hence the name Potion. Also, I thought it's kinda cool when
the footer says "Powered by Jekyll and Potion". :wink:

I started with Leonids and loved the sidebar. The sidebar was clean,
simple and tastefully designed. When I decided to include a more responsive
layout, Hyde came to mind and I adopted it. And when I decided to add
pagination to manage the increasing blog posts, the pagination from So Simple 
inspired me so much, I ended up including that into the mix as well.

All mistakes are mine alone.

_Did you know that Dr. Jekyll originally developed the
potion to suppress Mr. Hyde from appearing, not the other way round?_
